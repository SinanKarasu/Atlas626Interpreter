# Atlas626Interpreter

This is a work-in-progress open source resurrection of a large-scale ARINC 626 interpreter originally written in C++ using PCCTS (an early ANTLR predecessor) in the 1990s. The interpreter parses and executes ATLAS test language programs used in avionics systems.

## Status

ðŸš§ **This project currently does not fully compile or run.**  
Significant work is ongoing to modernize the codebase, replace legacy Rogue Wave containers with STL, and integrate with ANTLR4 in the future.

## Background

- Written originally in C++ using Sun Workshop tools.
- Uses PCCTS (v1.33, with modifications).
- Targets ATLAS 626-based test programs used in Boeing ATS-182+ systems.
- State machines written using `smc`, Robert C. Martinâ€™s original State Machine Compiler.
- Now being migrated for modern compilers on macOS.

## Goals

- Fully restore build capability on modern systems.
- Replace all Rogue Wave classes (e.g., `RWCString`, `RWTValVector`) with STL equivalents.
- Replace `smc` state machine definitions with a modern equivalent (if needed).
- Eventually: rewrite the grammar in ANTLR4 to replace PCCTS entirely.

## Build

Currently tested on macOS with:

- `clang`
- GNU coreutils
- Optional: `cssc` (GNU SCCS tools) to recover original source from historical SCCS repositories
